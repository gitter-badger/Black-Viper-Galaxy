The next best thing to StackOverflow.

## About
I, TreJon House am currently finishing my senior year of my undergrad career with a 
B.S. of Software Engineering at the Milwaukee School of Engineering University. I am 
a software engineer intern for IFS, in RnD (Research & Development) working on mobile 
applications. My past experiences include, QA intern for Cognex Machine Vision,
frontend web developer for Doubleberry Interactive, and QA contractor for Jackbox Games.
My passion is video games and AR/VR, and hope to one day go into game development.

## Goals
To create a site that hosts resources, topics, Q&A, meetups etc. all tailored specifically
to those in the world of technology, rather it be software, computer, MIS, or electrical
engineering, and a mobile app to compliment sed site.
 
###Short Term Goals
Get a simple simple frame work setup where a user can sign in and write a post, and make modifications
to their account.

##Where Are We/Me Now
I am trying to keep my wits about me while trying to get the ball rolling. I have the long term goals down
and have to stop myself from shooting the gun. With that said I'm trying to spend more time doing some long term planning,
and some real architecture and design going versus going straight down the rabbit hole. Compared to other things I've worked 
on such as my senior design project Rebel Kangaroo, this will be a slower moving project as to get a lot potential code smells
dished out, and apply good practices.

##Contributing
With that all said and done, this has the potential of becoming a huge project and like any big idea it needs supporters, so if you
have a spare moment and think you can contribute allbeit coding, testing, documenting or whatever, [email me](trejon_house@yahoo.com). And feel free to follow 
along via Slack or Taiga.
